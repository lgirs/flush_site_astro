    <p>
      We are Flush and you are very welcome to our website. We just re-built this site so please
      excuse any hickups that you might experience. On this site you will find our music, our gigs,
      our story and, in the near future, more fun content too. Maybe even games!
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that music is a community thing and it’s a thing that happens together. We are happy
      to have you here with us.
