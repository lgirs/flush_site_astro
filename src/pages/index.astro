    <p>Hello Friend! Welcome to the Flush internets!</p>
    <p>
      Flush is a rock band from Helsinki, Finland, and we like to describe ourselves as community rock.
      Once referred to as "an ideal band to book for funerals”, our foundation is in punk and 
      alternative rock, and then blending various flavours of rock and metal. At the core, our music 
      wants to be a safe space, or an escape if that is needed, for when the world feels a bit too much to handle. 
      Our music is for those who don’t always fit in and for those who need a place to belong. 
      Essentially, a community for anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this website of ours you’ll find the usual stuff you would expect from a band website. Links to music,
      gigs, etc. But there will be more! There will be games, gig trackers, scrapbooks, blogs, links to
      stories you might have missed… who knows what else. Come back as we grow the site!
    </p>
    <p>We’re glad you found us. Welcome to our community.</p>
