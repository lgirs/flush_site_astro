        <p>Hello Friend! Welcome to the Flush internets!</p>
        <p>
          Flush is a rock band from Helsinki, Finland, we like to describe ourselves as community rock.
          Once described as “an ideal band to book for funerals”, we are  bit of punk rock, quite a lot
          of alternative rock, and many other flavours of rock and metal. But most of all, we are a safe
          space or sometimes an escape for when the world feels like a bit too much. A community for those
          who don’t always fit in. A community for anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this website of ours you’ll find the usual stuff you would expect from a band. Links to music,
          gigs, etc. But there will be more! There will be games, gig trackers, scrapbooks, blogs, links to
          stories you might have missed… who knows what else. So come back as we grow the site and make this
          a part of the community.
        </p>
        <p>We’re glad you found us. Welcome to our community.</p>
