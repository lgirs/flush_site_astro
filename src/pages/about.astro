        We are Flush, a community rock band from Helsinki, Finland. Our purpose is simple:
        We make music, for ourselves and for you, to make us feel like we belong. Even if it’s
        just a short and sweaty moment in the moshpit at our shows, sharing a pint of cheap
        beer with an old or new friend while watching us play from a little further away, or listening
        to our songs in solitude in your favourite place… in these moments music
        connects us. Whether you are the misfit, the one who didn’t fit in, or you were the most
        popular kid in school, you are welcome in our community. We don’t write music for playlists
        or charts. We write for ourselves and we write for you. For all of us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musically, our foundation is punk and 90s alternative rock. On top, we add flavors from
        various metal and rock subgenres. Sometimes we’re loud and fast, sometimes slow and quiet.
        Sometime our music punches you in the face with certainty, sometimes we might sound fragile and
        introspective. We like to keep things dynamic and interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lyrically, we go where the pain is. Anxiety, depression, substance abuse, suicide, and
        loneliness frequently visit our songs, as do a wide range of political and societal questions.
        We also write about love and sex, and essentially about how we humans are with each other. We write about one and we write about all.
