    <!-- BIO -->

      <p>
        We are Flush, a community rock band from Helsinki, Finland. Our purpose is simple:
        We make music, for ourselves and for you, to make us feel like we belong. Even if it’s
        just a short and sweaty moment in the moshpit at our shows, or sharing a pint of cheap
        beer with an old or new friend watching us play from a little further away, or listening
        to our song on your headphones in your favourite safe place… in these moments music
        connects us. Whether you are the misfit or the one who didn’t fit in, or you were the most
        popular kid in school, you are welcome in our community. We don’t write music for playlists
        or charts; we write for ourselves and we write for you; for all of us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Musically, our foundation is punk and 90s alternative rock. On top, we add flavors from
        various metal and rock subgenres. Sometimes we’re loud and fast; sometimes slow and quiet.
        Sometime our music punches you in the face with its certainty; sometimes it’s fragile and
        introspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lyrically, we go where the pain is. Anxiety, depression, substance abuse, suicide, and
        loneliness frequently visit our songs, as do a wide range of political and societal questions.
        We also write about love and sex, and essentially about how we humans are with each other.

      <ul class="band">
        <li><strong>Lasse</strong> writes the songs and sings them, while playing offset shaped guitars</li>
        <li><strong>Janne</strong> composes and shreds the most incredible leads on his guitar</li>
        <li><strong>Eero</strong>'s bass guitar dominates our low and low-mid frequency range</li>
        <li><strong>Börje</strong> is the hardest-hitting drummer in the industry, but has the softest of smiles in the band.</li>
