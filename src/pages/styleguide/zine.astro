  <h1>Zine Style Guide</h1>
  <p>This is a test page for the new zine-style layout. We can experiment with fonts, colors, and backgrounds here.</p>
  
  <h2>This is a sample H2 heading</h2>
  <p>This is a paragraph of body text. It should be in a typewriter-style font. <a href="#">Links should be aggressive</a> and stand out, maybe with a solid background color on hover.</p>
  
  <h3>An H3 for subsections</h3>
  <p>More text to see how it flows. We can add blockquotes, lists, and other elements to test their styling in this new layout.</p>
