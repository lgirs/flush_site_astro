# Noises (2024)

*All lyrics by Lasse Girs. All rights reserved.*

## Gods and Masters

We didn’t just wade in  
Whichever god’s water  
We splashed it all around  
And then we drained it

We control, we decide

We can be reckless  
And lose control  
Cause we have the powers  
To fix it all

We control, we decide

We can adapt  
We will evolve  
Best of breed  
Superior

We control, we decide  
We are our own gods and masters.

## Headspinner

This morning my alarm rang backwards and I was wide asleep  
David Lynch was in my head, with a shaky camera and a bright headlight  
Last night was such a trip, I remember little, understand even less  
Is it morning or did I just wake up as I put my head down to sleep?

**Chorus**  
The owls will never make sense  
Wisdom is in acceptance

Oh to be one who enjoys the experience of life, and not solving it  
Oh to have a spotless mind, I don't care if it's sunshine or raining blood  
I worry so much that I worry about how much I worry  
The line between surreal and pretentious is surprisingly fine

**Chorus**

(It spins and spins, the vicious circle)  
Most of us are already insane  
The owls will never make sense

My head is spinning I don’t know how to move  
My body is shaking I cannot stay still  
My heart is racing but I don’t know where to  
My mind is crumbling I want out of this dream

I don't know what this means but I want out of this dream.

## Stella

A 70’s satellite from space  
Stella crashed into my place  
A soul adrift in the universe  
Lost in the haze, couldn't know better or worse

One night this falling star  
Arrived quietly from afar  
All the classic elements of desire  
She came and came, set it all on fire

**Chorus**  
Time stops  
Diversion  
Set, set  
Set it on fire

I knew what I was getting into  
The same old reasoned misconstrue  
Every time she rotated through that door  
A matter of minutes, her dress is on the floor

Unlike any time before  
I approach every time like there won’t be more  
Finding new details in her silhouette  
Reconnecting circuits so she won't forget

**Chorus**

Into the unknown

And if these flames don’t die  
We'll fly right through the sky  
I’ll build that rocket ship

Set it on fire.

---

## Dive

Down to the water  
I go down to your beach  
As the night gets darker  
The pearls start to glimmer

I hear the call  
I glide in  
You can only do it once  
It's a one-time thing

**Chorus**  
Let us dive in the dark  
Turn of all of our lights  
Follow the arc  
The sea knows only tonight

Feel the earth move  
Waves build up  
Brace for impact  
Too late to escape

Here it comes now  
Floods roll in  
Let go and lose control  
It's a primal thing

**Chorus**

Smooth waters  
Calm after the storm  
The distant horizon  
Is ready for another one...

Here it comes now  
Floods roll in  
Let go and lose control  
It's a primal thing

**Chorus**

Deep, dark waters roll  
This time don’t you run  
Let go, lose control.

## One Short Moment

I can read it from your face  
A face without expression  
And I can see it in your eyes  
Looking but never finding  
You never wanted to end up like this  
I think you're trying to find your way out  
But your body has given up  
And your mind's no longer home

I see you want to say something  
Your mind fights for words to form  
But then you just give up  
Surrender to the nothing  
Helplessly we try to ask  
Worried if you're in pain  
Maybe you no longer feel  
Maybe you're no longer here

And then we think of all those questions  
We never got to ask you  
And we think of all those questions  
You got stuck with and never got to ask  
Where was your real home?  
Where are you heading now?  
Yeah and who's there waiting for you?  
Will they know the real you?

And what if you don't remember  
when they ask you?  
What if you're still stuck in your maze  
trying to find your way out?  
Is that what your eyes search for?  
Is that what you want to ask?  
Just fuckin try to remember  
if only for that one short moment

We know you're gone  
We lost you to that empty look  
But I don't want to lose you tonight  
‘Cause no-one's about to die tonight  
We're not done yet with this fight

For one short moment  
Remember  
For one, for one, for one short moment.

## Send Somebody

Please send somebody over soon  
I'm hurting someone and I can't stop myself  
I don't know why and this isn't who I am  
Please come now, I can't stop myself

**Chorus**  
I kick and I punch  
I bite and I choke  
Please stop me before I kill  
I’ve no control  
And this is not me  
Please send somebody

They'll ask me questions, analyze me  
But I will have no answers, nor will they  
The switch is on and I can't turn it off  
Not a fuckin' clue of where it is

**Chorus**

Send send send someone  
Just send anyone  
Someone  
Anyone.

---

## One Simple Rule

There is no chosen one  
There are no spirits or other invisible forces  
No holy or other kinds of ghosts  
There is only us  
Our bodies and our minds  
And maybe something like a soul  
The only things that matter  
Are our actions and their consequences

**Chorus**  
We had one simple rule  
Leave everything the way you found it  
We had one simple rule  
And yet we failed ourselves

Let us prey  
Hunt down all that is alive  
And re-create it  
Into money, poison and waste  
Build walls, fences and hierarchies  
To control what is left  
Achieve our final goal and purpose  
Destruction of all

**Chorus**

Funny how we say she's our mother  
And yet we show no respect  
Compare that to the father  
The one who'll judge us all  
Oh yeah, Judgement Day is coming  
But it's not coming from up above us  
It's coming from right beneath our feet  
And we've earned every part of it  
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming, it’s coming...

**Chorus.**

---

## We’re Not Yet Alright

There is more love in this room  
Than I’ll ever find at home  
Someone is always here

A sincere smile to greet  
At the always open door  
All the promise of relief

**Chorus**  
Don't send us home tonight  
We're not ready for the light  
No longer lost but found  
Don’t send us home tonight  
We’re not yet alright  
At least another round

Stories etched into the walls  
And the wrinkles of these friends  
A sanctuary for the ones with empty homes

Let us drown into  
all these shades of gold and not spare  
any thoughts to the next day

**Chorus**

Vacant hearts  
Holes to be filled  
Stories to connect  
Lost souls to be found

We're all fucked  
So let's be fucked together  
We're all fucked  
So let's be fucked together.

## Noises in My Head

(Come to me, my sweet pain  
Inject yourself into my veins, my sweet pain)

I wanna be  
A woman  
I keep tearing my skin off  
It's bad and dirty

I wanna be  
A drunk  
I want to be an alcoholic  
It runs in my veins

**Chorus**  
Won't show it  
Can't show it  
All these noises  
In my head

I wanna be  
In constant pain  
Like the great ones  
A troubled poet; I will never be

I wanna die  
But I don't hate myself  
I'm just a lost soul  
swimming in this bowl of shit

**Chorus**

I'm not a good man  
We should establish this from the start  
It’s a chronic condition  
Eating me up inside  
I will conceive you  
Then I'll hurt you, leave you scarred  
And yet you'll love me  
For my beautiful darkness

(Noises, noises, noises)  
**Chorus**

(Come to me, my sweet pain  
Never leave, my sweet pain).

---

## Accelerate

Here comes the multi-universe taxi, baby  
I’ve packed a few bottles of booze and some smokes  
I know you won’t forget to take your hat, baby  
Wear that black dress and bring all your hopes

The ride is merely an excuse, the story is you  
A thousand tales in your eyes, desire on your lips  
No words spoken, yet all of them true  
We both go down to face the eclipse

Drain me in your waters  
Leave your smell on my face  
Let my veins know you have arrived  
The length of that dress is perfection

From one world to another we drive  
Not a care of where and how long  
Dancing to the highs  
Your well never running out

Go fast, go slow, accelerate

**Chorus**  
Go fast, go slow, accelerate  
Take a turn, go low, radiate  
Open your mouth, shut down my mind, and elevate me  
Across these universes, we congregate

Go faster until we crash and burn  
Both broken in a compatible way  
Nothing to fix, just step on it  
I hope you didn’t forget your hat, baby

**Chorus.**

## Unfinished Films (feat. DD Slick)

There were no ever afters  
No happy endings or airport meets  
Just a long list of great plot ideas  
None of them finished

Now all that is left in the script  
Is a static entity without an expression  
How do you film something like that?  
Nobody would ever watch it

**Chorus**  
All the tones of the black and white tape  
Lost their spirit and disposition  
Turned into a monotone landscape  
An undeveloped, lifeless condition  
Another scene from an unfinished film

There were no reconciliations  
There was no genuine forgiveness  
Nothing will be forgotten  
There will be no healing

**Chorus**

Drop the string arrangements, drop the fireworks  
No beauty from joy, no beauty found in sorrow  
Another promising manuscript with meaningless words on a screen  
Another story of anticipation never making it until the end

**Chorus**

Another scene from an unfinished film.

---

## The End

This is the day, this is the time when everything that was built  
must be torn down  
It's a surprise, a sudden twist, faith playing tricks on our behalf  
there was no stopping it  
Once I pull my head out my ass and face the facts, cause and effect,  
we had it coming  
I'll take the blame, I'll take the punches, but it will never be me  
cause I knew it along

**Chorus**  
C'mon join me tonight  
In this beautiful end

We built it tall, we built it high, with views to die for  
yeah but now it must come down  
World's tallest building, yeah but whose world is it this time, can you say?  
And how does one get there?  
Have no remorse, have no regrets, the dynamite is in its place  
It's all set for the push  
So what's the use of writing songs no-one will hear, least likely you -  
a coward's apology

**Chorus.**

---

## It’s All Right if You Gotta Go

Gotta open the blinds and let in some air  
This darkness is making me restless  
The comfort of booze and delightful high  
Don’t cut it no more, I feel helpless

Now in writing this song, all I really want  
Is to figure out if I’m really hollow  
If I make it all the way ‘til the end  
You’ll be the first one to know

**Chorus**  
It’s all right if you gotta go  
‘Cause I don’t think we’ll ever be all right, be all right again  
It’s all right if you gotta go  
‘Cause I don’t think we’ll ever be all right, be all right again

I think most of my life I've collected dirt  
And lately it's been pouring down on it  
My vast collection now is just mud  
And I spend my days staring into it

There is beauty in the shades of shit  
There is beauty at the bottom of the sea, just like  
It’s obvious, the reason  
I don’t trust you is I don’t trust myself

**Chorus**

There must be something better  
There must be something that makes some sense  
We shouldn’t be this lost

**Chorus.**

# Conspiracies, Threats and Chaos (2021 EP)

*All lyrics by Lasse Girs. All rights reserved.*

## Kings and Queens

(Verse 1)  
Daylight fades again  
The emperor has new clothes  
Smooth, black leather  
Spikes, zippers and chains  
The working man prepares  
Just survived another day  
Tonight he'll be the king  
Time to give some back

(Chorus)  
Kings and queens  
And criminal queers  
Bodies bare but never sincere  
Kings and queens  
And these criminal queers  
Behind these walls no-one hears their screams

(Verse 2)  
Oh here comes the dawn  
But the mask stays on  
We go our separate ways  
After all, we're not the same

---

## Weak and Wrong

(Verse 1)  
Ignorance, racism, capitalism,  
greed is profit, and success  
Nationalism, sexism, bigotry  
We got fame, status, power  
Tolerance is a negative trait  
In the fascist playbook  
The white man has earned his rank and position  
Don't be weak, don't be wrong

(Chorus)  
Don't be weak, don't be wrong (don't be different)

(Verse 2)  
We see everything. No need to hide.  
You know it. We all know it.  
There is nothing you can't do, won't do  
No consequence, the game is rigged  
How many generations to change  
You don't care, you'll be long gone  
How many generations lost  
You don't care, you never did

(Middle 8)  
Build more machines to run your world  
Automated bias protects and serves  
Artificial replicas of your mind  
Driven by the same fears, same lies, your lies

(Verse 3)  
Your desperate attempts to confuse  
Conspiracies, threats and chaos  
It all works, we are too weak

---

## Cut Me Open

(Verse 1)  
Cut me open  
Sink your teeth in  
My flesh and my mind  
Down to my bones  
Frail and desolate  
Don't be gentle  
Pull the knife now  
Cut me open

(Chorus)  
I want to get lost again in that universe you hide  
That is black as the night, the only glow is the blade of the knife  
Reflecting all my shadows as it cuts me open

(Verse 2)  
No remorse  
No regret  
This is all we have  
This is all we are  
The deeper you go, the less it hurts  
Get it all out, no going back  
Cut me open

(Outro)  
Sharpen the knife, I won't run  
My skin is hard, old and scarred

---

## Entertainment

(Verse 1)  
Tonight we'll get loud  
It's been a while, yeah, it's been too long  
We've all made it, we're the lucky ones  
Good to see you all  
We've earned this night of entertainment  
Drinks and rock'n roll  
One for those who could not make it  
Raise your glass - we must never forget

(Chorus)  
Here we are now  
Let’s do some entertainment  
Turn on the PA  
Let’s lay waste to the bar  
Gather around  
Down your drinks  
We missed you  
And you missed us  
Let’s get pissed and count to four  
1-2-3-4

(Verse 2)  
What's your poison tonight  
I'll have a beer and I'll have a whisky  
The sheriff's in town with his lone star  
He'll see you tonight at the Barley & Bait  
We'll curse the pandemic, depression and politics  
Share stories about our friends  
Before the music you know it's shot time  
We count to four and down 'em on one

(Middle 8)  
Let's feel really bad tomorrow  
Who's to know what kind of sorrow  
The future has in store  
No-one gets to be a bore  
C’mon, let's not waste another night

---

# It Began as a Mistake (2020)

*All lyrics by Lasse Girs. All rights reserved.*

## Shine

A collision of bodies causing a swirl  
Creating a strange, parallel world  
It spins and spins in a different direction  
Its motion driven by a profound connection

This could be our last attempt  
To shine a light into our dark  
We've travelled far, we've given up, oh yeah  
Now everything will be all right

All of these stars we see are the same  
Even in this new upside down way  
Everyone's broken, no light shines bright  
Where the broken pieces join is our light

---

## Dark

We should hurry now  
I wanna be there when the band begins to play  
I want the music loud  
I want it to numb my pain

Why am I haunted by this again?  
I need these thoughts and dreams away  
I won't sleep tonight, let the  
monsters loose in my mind  
and shadows appear  
Will you

Dream?  
Like me, will you see the same?  
I wish your story is new  
I wish you're something else than where you're from

One thing dies for new  
The sun sets one last time  
Shadows creeping in and it gets dark

It's not death that scares me,  
it's life, and the final calls  
The show is over, the night is quiet,  
and I hear it all

---

## Cheap Beer

One of us stepped in front of a train  
Out of the blue, there was nothing he said  
The word was out he'd been drinking alone  
Lost his future for reasons unknown

One of us learnt to never let go  
He got it young, the way his folks would show  
One, two, three, always time for one more  
He's got a child now, will he pass it on?

Cheap beer, rock songs, Friday nights  
Small boys with dreams of bright lights  
Cheap beer, rock songs, Friday lights  
How we dreamt of bright nights

A daughter's pain would not go away  
8 years old it won't help if you pray  
The diagnose, yeah, it starts with a 'C'  
But she's a fighter, stronger than you and me

This song's been sang a million times  
and this our rendition  
A tradition, we carry on  
We still pick up our guitars and  
plug them in and crank them up, and play  
our songs loud, like we always have

Some of us survived and some didn't  
Some lives ended, some are only beginning  
We used to dream, never knowing what's next  
That future's past, not quite what we expected

Let's have a drink for those who are gone.

---

## Two-Minute Punk Song

She's a two-minute punk song  
She's the queen of fuck offs  
Words come at you fast  
Smart wit, mean tongue

She's got the fastest blast  
And the highest smoke  
You're either with her  
Or you are against

Are you feelin' it  
What's this gonna be  
That is her teeth  
Sinkin' in

Got monkeys as slaves  
Slaves as monkeys  
Naked in black tie  
An empress on her throne

In her golden suit  
Made of their skin  
Ripped off in a ritual  
Are you feeling this?

You won't  
make it  
out alive  
This is your end

---

## Break Me

When you have everything you ever said you wanted in your life  
But it’s clear to all that you’re still discontented

Maybe the problem is not in everything that is around you  
Look inside, you’ve got some soul searching to do

You can taste me  
You can shake me  
But what you make me  
It will break me

Even when the sky is clear dark clouds keep you company  
And everyone around you becomes a casualty

Next time maybe try a new approach to your life  
Commit to one home and not just cheap hotels

---

## Chemicals and Conversation

Never saw this coming when you broke the news  
When you said you're not the one I thought I knew  
Yeah, you say you are and they say it too,  
but they're not your bloodline they're not dependent  
They don't have death patrolling outside every night

Right here in this moment in time  
we need you to be here with us

They don't speculate each day who you are,  
they don't share the room with your darkness  
And I know, and I know, and I know,  
it's not about us, it's about you  
It's about the voices only you hear,  
about the feelings only you feel  
About the void you're in all alone,  
is it your perception or reality?

Right here in this moment in time  
we need you to be here with us

And when none of it really matters,  
when we don't even have the right questions to ask  
Rely on chemicals and conversation,  
on lithium and listening  
On luck, hope and some of us prayer,  
on reason and the power of thought  
All the time recognizing that your monsters...

They've infiltrated that reason,  
they've skewed our logic, they've planted fear  
Yeah but right here and now  
in this moment in time we need you  
To be here with us  
To be here with us

We were always the same  
Now everything has changed  
I don't know who you are  
If you die by your own hand

---

## Tiny Changes

"While I'm alive, I'll make tiny  
changes to Earth" was the line you wrote  
And while you laid it all out  
We were all so helpless

You brought me back to my youth  
All those nights of thinking  
What it would be like if I  
was no more in this life

The bridge, the water, carrying us away  
From our demons, tormentors and shadows  
No more darkness or anxiety  
One solution to all our problems  
Let's swim out and then just stop

Outside's getting darker  
Nights getting colder again  
Our minds wander of, as they do  
Uncontrollable thoughts

What if we found a ray of light  
What if someone knew where we were  
What if we are not alone  
What if there is a cure for us

The bridge, the water, carrying us away  
From our demons, tormentors and shadows  
No more darkness or anxiety  
One solution to all our problems  
Let's swim out and then get back

---

## Ships

Another ship sailed away  
And you chose to stay  
Controlled by your shadow  
There is no tomorrow

All these ships passing by  
You try to deny  
They take something from you  
You can't undo

And then time passes by  
And slowly your light  
Grows dimmer until your  
Shadows are no more

It will hit you hard  
When all of your scars  
Remind you you're losing  
Yeah, you need to start moving

I'm a hard-working coward  
Old enough to be scared  
Of moving forward  
I just can't be bothered

Content with today  
Looking forward as well  
Just as long tomorrow  
Is like today

I'm sure you can see  
For every day  
That goes by your start to  
Look more like me

I am you tomorrow  
We'll share the same shadows  
Don't you stop tryin'  
Yeah, you need to get movin'

---

## Bad Time

I feel like shit  
'Cause I don't really care  
Yeah I don't  
This time this is it

So why'd you write me  
It's been two years  
Oh you're lost now  
And you'd like my words

Not a single day goes by  
Without remorse of what was never heartfelt  
Most of us leave these things behind  
But not me, not these ones; we'll forever hold on

Yeah this is  
a bad time  
But let's not fool anyone  
It won't be the last

To words that meant so much but in different ways  
To stories that grabbed us but for a different cause  
One day maybe we'll share  
An understanding of what never was

---

## Surreal Experiment

This is a surreal experiment  
In the age of post intellect  
Got concentration camps and arm salutes  
White torches on parade, nights of broken glass

How did we let this get so far  
How did we lose our direction

Lies upon lies, amplified by  
The voice of State Incorporated  
Authority shoots another unarmed  
Another child locked up to become a slave

How did we let this get so far  
How did we lose our direction  
We've moved so far right that we have  
Lost sight of what's right

The extreme is the new norm  
The unthinkable is real  
The war against the bastards  
And the war within ourselves

We all need a break but the fight goes on  
Cause not a fuckin day goes by without  
Another soul crushing story  
Our senses become numb we have to look away

---

## The Rush

My head is spinning I can't stop shaking  
These vicious images make no sense  
Just like me they go astray  
I'm in head first, give me some more

No shame for letting it out  
Intention is irrelevant  
Unleash the true beast within  
Don't hold it back any more

The true you is in this nightmare  
It's time to set it free  
Unleash the true beast within  
It will dance on your... on your grave

I cannot make this trembling stop  
My hands, my mind and my heart  
Same old poison in my veins  
One day I'll learn – it's not today

Don't feel shame  
Don't hold back  
Let the rush set yourself free again

---

## In the Gutter

Woken up by the hard tiles of the floor  
The squares on my shoulders prove it all  
Engraved into my skin so I won't forget  
Doesn't fade away like all regret

Tell me was it worth it this time  
This room stinks of all I did last night  
Tell me how I ended up here  
Let's dig into all my deepest fears

My master calling to join him  
In the gutter  
My sweet temptation  
Never too early to start  
I feel it coming  
Give me my sedation

The emptiness that they described  
Before their suicides  
Is it this nagging feeling I have?  
Just sitting here staring into nowhere

It wrenches my guts, I can't explain it  
I can see this being the same familiar shit  
This fuckin' thing that makes our souls sink  
Let's reminisce over a drink

Feel it coming  
Let's reminisce  
Over a drink  
In the gutter

---

## New World Order

Hooray for the right-wing capitalist  
caught up in his lie  
About free markets, will and choice  
none of which exist

Hooray for the left-wing radical  
all caught up in himself  
He wants attention, wants to shock  
but never gets his change

It's a new world order  
Where it's not 'what' it's 'how'  
We gave control to loudness  
To lazy, greedy ignorance  
That made it all black and white  
And we're too far up our own ass  
To take a look around

Hooray for the compromise,  
a watered-down meaningless pact  
A display of determination to drive  
that doesn't mean a thing  
Hooray for the wise ones,  
the introverted tiny souls  
With opinions and critique to share,  
just not their own name

Hooray for the commercial media,  
selling us the news we buy  
Fuck their educational duty,  
sensation's what we deserve  
Hooray for the sarcastic cynic  
writing his piercing prose  
Shreds ideologies and naive beliefs  
but doesn't have any of his own

Hooray  
Hooray  
Hooray
